        h3 Why another JavaScript framework?
        p.
          Well, I really like #[a(href='https://cycle.js.org') Cycle.js]. 
          It's a nice reactive framework. 
          But it's too #[a(href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function') pure] for me. 
        p.
          With #[strong Cyclow], instead of thinking in a big global model and pure functions, 
          you have to think in interconnected #[em components] with async inputs/outputs and their own state. 
          It's something like an electronic circuit, where you can wire up electronic components. 
          Cyclow aims to be more intuitive and easier while it's still reactive and quite declarative.
